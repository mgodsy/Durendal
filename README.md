# Welcome to Project Durendal
## Genre: 
```markdown
Side Scrolling Platform|Shooter (Super Metroid, Contra, and conceptually closest to, Metal Slug)

Placing a game into some sort of genre creates artificial restrictions on the creation of the game
and I'd rather not do that. However, with out giving you, the reader, some sort of guiding conceptual
make-up of the game I'd like to design, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about.
